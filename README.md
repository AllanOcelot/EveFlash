# EveFlash
EveFlash is a web based 'Flashcard' minigame for learning the ships of Eve Online.
If you've ever been on a fleet - and someone has shouted over comms 'We have three thrashers on D-Scan' and you don't know what that is.... Maybe a couple rounds of Eve Flash will help you.

The idea is to expose you to the Ships in a FlashCard style game, once you've learned the ships, you will better understand their strengths and weaknesses.


### Current Version (2) features:
 - The basic mini game functions with minimal ship data ( Mostly Minmatar )
 - There's a difficulty/length and faction selection settings component in place.
 - It looks neato.

### Next Version MVP :
  - Complete factional data for the 'big four'

### Long Term Feature Roadmap
  - Leaderboard
  - 3D ship view
  - Ship data with ALL Eve online ships
  - Different difficulties will require different inputs / questions. ( i.e - what type of tank does this ship have )
  - Link Ship Data to EveWiki if people wish to learn more (?)

## To Contribute:
I'm always eager for people to contribute, I'd be especially thankful if people wish to correct ship data.
